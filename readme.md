AXI4-Stream cocotb extension
==

My take on the AXI4 stream utilities as a Cocotb extension. Currently not targeted to be a full implementation, just the barebones required to get another project going.

For development purposes, pull this repository and install locally using:

```bash
$ python3 -m pip install -e .
```
